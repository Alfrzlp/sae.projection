Description: The sae.projection package provides tools for performing Small Area Estimation (SAE) using projection-based methods.
    This approach is particularly useful for generating reliable domain-level estimates in cases where sample sizes are too small for direct estimation. 
    By leveraging auxiliary information and statistical models, the package enhances the precision and accuracy of small area estimates.
